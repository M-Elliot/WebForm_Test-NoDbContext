# Basic C# WebForm Example ASP.Net & Foundation 6 
> A Simple First-Attempt Example of a WebForm designed in ASP.Net & Foundation 6. (No DbContext or CRUD)
>> I am by no means a front-end developer so apologies for bad practices

A ***"Junior Interview Test"*** *which also intends to be a full week of work? For free? For a **potential** interview*...

This is what was completed before I consolodated with others and confirmed the feeling i was being taken advantage of and stopped.


__**The Test Requirements:**__
```
• The three PNG files should be used to guide the coding and images cut out where required.
• You must use the Foundation framework to build the responsive layouts (http://foundation.zurb.com/)
• The page structure should be hand coded in HTML & CSS, without the aid of any WYSIWYG editors.
• All text content should be held in a database (MS SQL Server or Access) and displayed on using ASP.Net (with C#) and web forms (i.e. not MVC).
• Product categories along the bottom should be displayed using an asp:Repeater, and be coming from a database table.
• A small content management system should be built to allow for the editing of the content of this page.
• No tier-pages need producing, only the home page.
• Note that desktop version is 1920px wide, the content area is only 1280px except for the top banner which is 100% width (1920px).
```
